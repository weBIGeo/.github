This organisation hosts the code for the [weBIGeo project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/weBIGeo) [netIdee](https://www.netidee.at/) project. The work is based on [alpinemaps.org](https://alpinemaps.org), where you can also find a demo of the current state.

Policy:
- All work funded by netidee will go into this repository.
- We will regularly synchronise the weBIGeo and AlpineMaps.org repositories by pull requests and pulls.
